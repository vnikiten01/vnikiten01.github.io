		<h1> Pair Reflection</h1>
		<p>Viktor's Reflection</p>
		<p>Pairing for the first time was lot easier than I first though it would be.  Using the different apps including Google HAngout and Stypi to share code and communicate made it a smooth process.  I did enjoy working with another person on this assignment.  I believe we were able to overcome coding issues much faster by throwing our own ideas and experiences.  The one thing we struggled with was sharing files with one another, to take the simple way out we just emailed information back and forth when we switched roles as Driver and Navigator.</p>  
		<p>Patrick's Reflection</p>
		<p>Pairing for the first time was an enjoyable experience. I learned a number of miscellaneous things. Some of it little things other big things. I gained a better understanding of positioning elements in HTML/CSS. I got a good feel for how to work together and best ways to work on code together.</p>
