			<h4> I never though to ask myself before if I ask good quesitons or not.  After reading about how to form a good question and reviewing my Google+ posts I realize that my questions are not always that coherent. 

				To start with I sometimes make grammical errors.  That would be a huge problem for someone coming to help me on an issue.  If I can't spend the time to make something more readable why should someone use there time to help me.  No more of that, double check my spelling from now on and try not to sent posts from my phone.  In some posts I notice that I include language and platformation information into but it does not come of naturally. Again this goes hand in hang to making something more readable and understandable.  

				There was one post, I was trying to get help with an exercise problem and the person asked me what action I was expecting.  I sometimes forget that problems are not so obvious to people trying to help.  They may not fully undertand the context from which the question is being formed or perhaps the problem just needs to be formed in another way in another way for it to make sense.

				Either way here are my rules to follow for asking the perfect quesiton.

				Clear and concise
				Naturally Flowing
				Include images and examples if applicable
				Describe the expected outcome
				Don't use abbreviations
				Seperate questions into paragraphs
				Spell Check
				Proof read
