			<h4><strong>What is computer memory?<strong></h4>
			<h4>Any form of electronic storage is considered computer memory.  Accessing information from a computers harddrive is a slow process.  For this reason information gets stored in memory and can be accessed at a much fast rate.  

				These is a hierarchy to accessing memory.  The CPU will first access the random access memory (RAM), followed by whatever storage devices the computer might have(e.g. hard drives, USB drives) and lastly by unput sources (e.g. mouse, keyboard).

			<h4>From the moment a computer is turned on to the time it is turned off computer memory is being used.  When a computer is started the operating system (Windows or Linux) is loaded from the hard drive into the RAM.  Not the whole operating system as that would be huge but essential components which the CPU would frequently access.  When an application is started, it's loaded into the RAM, just like what occurs with the operating system it will only load the important parts and others on a, as needed basis.  Files loaded into an application are loaded into the RAM.  After use, when the file is saved and the application is closed the data gets stored into the hard drive memory and the memory in RAM is deleted to make space for the next application.  


				There are different forms of computer memory out there.  CPUs these days can run at speeds of 1 gighertz and consume large amounts of data.  The problem is these CPUs are expensive.  To overcome this problem, designers have created "tiering" memory. This works as large inexpensive memory backs up small quantities of that large expensive CPU memory we mentioned.  What is the large inexpensive memory that we are referring too.  Simple, the hard drive memory and the allocation at this level for use with the CPU memory is termed "vitual memory".

				The next level of memory the RAM (working memory.)  RAM speed is based on bus width and bus speed.  Bus width is the number of bits that can be sent to the CPU and bus speed is the number of times those bits can be sent each second. If you every come accross a 100-MHZ 32-bit bus this means it can sent 4 bytes (1 byte=8bits, 4bytes=32bits) at 100 millions times/second.    

				The last level of memory, sits between the RAM and the CPU is called the Cache.  It is a small amount of memory that stores data of considerable high prority.  Data that the CPU uses most often, and it sits nearest to the CPU, physically it's actually build right onto it.    

				ROM -Read only memory.  This is permanent memory storing control programs and system software.  Data in this class is used to performing booting on startup so deleting it would not be in anyones interest.</h4>
