			<h4>It was quite some time ago, but still stands out in my mind, that I came into some serious conflict with one of my best friends.  The conflict was in regards to how he was treating his friends and obviously myself.  He was lying to us in big ways that affected our trips together.  He would be constantly unreachable for days at a time through any form of communication.  And lastly he just showed any lack of respect to our time and our concerns.  A very "F it" attitude.  

				I was aware of his apathy for some time and still attempted to make an effort to get together,  hangout, and talk out these issues as they would come up.  I found myself constantly disappointed at his lack of concern for regarding my concerns and clearly identified him as a major source of conflict in my life.  After all why spend time with people that don't show you the respect that you show them, a friend that you have known for 10+ years and considered a brother.

				I found myself getting no where with him and my other friends, as equally frustrated, decided it was better to avoid the issues and accept it for what it is. I took a different approach.  Identifying him as the clear cause of much conflict in my life I decided to cut ties.  I would not communicate with him, reach out to him, avoid social environments that I knew he would be attending as much as possible.  This made things very difficult and awkward for my other friends as they were caught in the middle of this and I could never get them to see my point of view, that a bad friend is not a friend worth keeping, life's too short.  My ostracization lasted just about a year before I decided it was worth revisiting.  To this day we are friends, he has not changed, I do accept it by having no expectations.  


				I cannot total speak for how my actions impacted the situation.  For myself the conflict just appeared to have switched to another means.  Like there would be that mentioned awkwardness when hangout with mutual friends or getting together for birthdays and outings.  Overall this did no compare to the conflict that I was going through trying to figure out what his problem was and constantly failing at trying to get him to see my point of view.

				Looking back, knowing now how cutting ties with him for that limited amount of time and eventually just being friends again, I don't think I would do anything different.  The experience was a great life lesson for myself.  I could not resolve a conflict despite numerous attempts at trying and found myself washing my hands of it.  These days I am a bit more meticulous in those I consider friends and attempt to make sure I treat them the way I wish to be treated.  If I notice an imbalance in the way things are going I am much quicker and in cutting ties for good.  And more times than ever they stay cut, because after all you there are only so many days in a year and why not spend it with the people that enjoy your company as much as you enjoy theres.
