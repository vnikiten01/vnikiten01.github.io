    <h4>My Reflection</h4>
    <h5> Describe responsive design
     summary, the spectrum of screen sizes and resolutions is widening every day, and creating a different version of a website that targets each individual device is not a practical way forward. This is the problem that responsive web design addresses head on.
     <p>
       Responsive websites are built on a fluid grid and use media queries to control the design and its content as it scales down or up with the browser or device.  The overall goal of responsive design is planning for the furture when unknown browsers and resolution sizes are implements.</p>
       <h5>What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h5>

       <p>The biggest problem that was brough on in this challenege was lack of resources.  I felt that the resources provided were not sufficient to teach use the proper coding to complete the challange.  One example I can think was positioing the @media commands at the end of the css document and knowing to fill the different commands inside it's brackets.</p>

       <h5>What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h5>

       <p>W3school as usual was a giant help in figuring out appropriate positioning techniques that needed to be implemented.</p>

       <h5>What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?</h5>

       <p>Positioning remains the most diffuclt concept to grasp. knowing when to use floats versus inline-block and how they actually interact with the code can be a huge challange.
        Concepts that I have a better understanding of thanks to this challange is inheritance of css styling code by the elements.  I didn't have much prior experience in child and parent elements overiding each other's different attributes.  Now I feel I have start to scratch the concepts of them interacting with one another.  And this is very important in building reponsive designs.

      </p>

      <h5>Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h5>

      <p>Dev tools and REsponsive web design tester app from google were great for this exercise.  With Devtools one of my new tricks is to digest code from other sites in regards to syntax and formating.

      </p>

      <h5>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h5>

      <p>I feel extremly confident in each of the learning competencies.  I believe I have a good grasp of was the different website designs exists, their strengths over one another and their uses.</p>

      <h5>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</h5>

      <p>I very much enjoyed working with a partner on this challange.  I believe without their assistance I would still be trying to figure out how to make the code responsive</p>

      <h5>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h5>

      <p>Positioning was one of the most tedious things about this challange.  But the worst would have to be figuring out inheritance coding for the different resolutions.  Where the code goes, how it interacts with one another </p>
